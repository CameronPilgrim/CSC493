<h2>CSC493 @ Berea College </h2>

Here is the repo to upload your work for the CSC493. 
If you have any questions regarding the instruction below, 
do not hesitate to contact either me, Carley or Dr.Richard

<h2> Instruction </h2>

<code>git clone https://github.com/AlekKras/CSC493.git</code>

<code>cd <i>folderName</i></code>

<code>git remote</code>

You can also specify <code>-v</code>, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote:

<code>git remote -v</code>

Then you upload your code and run

<code>git add .</code>

<code>git commit -m "Commit"</code>

<code>git push</code>

The other way is to just submit it manually or use GitHub Desktop for Windows. Anything is fine. Terminal is preferred.
