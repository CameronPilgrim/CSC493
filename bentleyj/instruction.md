There are couple ways how to do it. The easiest one is through git terminal.

Just run <code>git clone <i>url</i></code>

Then you will have the git repo on your local computer. 

Run <code>cd <i>repo</i></code>

Then you should run <code>git remote</code>

Then upload your code there and run
<code>git add .</code>
<code>git commit -m "Your commit"</code>
